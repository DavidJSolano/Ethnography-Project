# Ethnography-Project
This website is dedicated to showcasing some photos that I took while studying abroad in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The setting takes place in the former concentration camp, Vught. The atrocities that occurred in Vught during World War II are forever captured and documented by the Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught museum (location of photos).
